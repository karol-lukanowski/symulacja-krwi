  abstract  = {We present a technique for proving the security of quantum-key-distribution (QKD) protocols. It is based on direct information-theoretic arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze the Bennett-Brassard 1984, the six-state, and the Bennett 1992 protocols with one-way error correction and privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more robust against noise in the quantum channel.},

This strong form of security is possible only when using correlations that violate a Bell inequality. Here, we provide a general security proof for a large class of protocols in a model in which the raw key is generated by independent measurements. This independence condition may be justifiable in several implementations and is necessarily satisfied when the raw key is generated by N separate pairs of devices. Our work shows that device-independent QKD is possible with key rates comparable to those of standard schemes.},

 et al 2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 010401), we introduced an
 infinite hierarchy of conditions necessarily satisfied by
 any set of quantum correlations. Each of these conditions
 could be tested using semidefinite programming. We present
 here new results concerning this hierarchy. We prove in
 particular that it is complete, in the sense that any set
 of correlations satisfying every condition in the hierarchy
 has a quantum representation in terms of commuting
 measurements. Although our tests are conceived to rule out
 non-quantum correlations, and can in principle certify that
 a set of correlations is quantum only in the asymptotic
 limit where all tests are satisfied, we show that in some
 cases it is possible to conclude that a given set of
 correlations is quantum after performing only a finite
 number of tests. We provide a criterion to detect when such
 a situation arises, and we explain how to reconstruct the
 quantum states and measurement operators reproducing the
 given correlations. Finally, we present several
 applications of our approach. We use it in particular to
 bound the quantum violation of various Bell inequalities.},
